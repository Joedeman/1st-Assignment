# 1st Assignment

My first homework assignment working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## What I Learned

In creating my first web application, I gained valuable experience in:

- **HTML**: Understanding the structure of web pages and how to effectively use elements to create a coherent layout.
- **CSS**: Applying styles to enhance the visual appeal of the application and learning how to create responsive designs.
- **JavaScript**: Implementing interactivity, which allowed me to engage users and make the application dynamic.

You can view the application by navigating to the following URL:
